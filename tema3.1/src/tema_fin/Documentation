In this Project I wrote a little program where the user can get the time one or more
space ships need to travel between planets. The planets are set in a 3 dimensional 
coordinate system. and the origin of the system is the Sun. 
The coordinates will be converted in light years.
The menu allows the user to:
	Press the 'a' key: Add a planet. The user will be asked about the name of 
	the planet and it's position/More planets and their positions.
Press the 'b' key: 
	 The user can delete the added planets. The program ignores the not necessary spaces
	 The planets' names can be written anyhow. The program ignores uppercase and lowercase.
Press the 'c' key: 
	The user adds the space ship(s) itineraries.
Press the 'd' key: 
	The user will get the time you need to get between every planet that was introduced before.
	The speed of the spaceship(s) is a constant 40000 km/h.
Press the 'e' key:
	Exit the app.
